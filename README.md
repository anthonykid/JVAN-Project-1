# JVAN-Project-1
This is the git project for JVAN Team 01
We made application that is using sqlite to keep the data
we made the application to keep To-Do List for people to use, it has a date when the To-Do List is created and after the user is done doing what is inside the list, the user can add the item using the button from top right corner, and then a pop up for user to input what they wanted to add in the app, then the user can delete it from the list by swiping from right to left of the item in the list.
Here is some of the preview in the application

This is the splash screen.
